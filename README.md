## The Story

At Hive Helsinki, students need to request room bookings from staff members, creating a manual workflow that's time-consuming. As students ourselves, we saw an opportunity to apply what we learned in school to solve a real-world problem.

**Book Me** was born from this need - a streamlined room booking system that eliminates the manual overhead while providing a smooth, modern user experience.
